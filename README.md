# namemc-discord

This is a Discord bot I created, which allows you to check the availability and history of Minecraft usernames. This bot is currently very WIP, many more features are to come.

## Current list of commands:

- ```!check <name>``` -- checks the availability and popularity of specified name. If the name is available soon, says when it is available.
- ```!history <name>``` -- returns a list of people who have had specified name.
- ```!select <number>``` -- used in response to ```!history``` to view the naming history of one of the people listed in ```!history```.
- ```!help``` -- view a list of commands.
